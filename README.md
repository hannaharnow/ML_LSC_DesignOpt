# ML_LSC_DesignOpt

This Design Optimization utilizes data generated from an existing Monte Carlo Simulation for Luminescent Solar Concentrators (LSC)
as well as Energy Estimate code to determine the optimal geometry for an LSC using the Machine Learning method of Neural Networks and tree-based regressors. 
Cost of manufacturing and performance of the LSC are taken into account in this design optimization.
